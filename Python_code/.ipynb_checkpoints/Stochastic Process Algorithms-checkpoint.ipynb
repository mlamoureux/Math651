This notebook contains the code presented in the article for four stochastic processes often used to model the evolution of asset prices and two mean-reverting stochastic processes often used to model the evolution of interest rates. Thes models include Brownian Motion (a Wiener Process), Geometric Brownian Motion, the Merton Jump Diffusion Model, the Heston Stochastic Volatility Model, the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) process, and the Ornstein Uhlenbeck Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random event is any event which has a chance of happening. Probability is the measure of that chance. Random variables are functions which receive a random event and return a real number. Random variables may be discrete or continuous; discrete random variables are ones with a countable number of possible outcomes; continuous random variables are ones which have an infinite number of possible outcomes. In the context of finance, a stochastic process is a collection of random variables which describe the evolution of a system over some period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of random variables and stochastic processes is that they can be used to describe what is happening in the world around us. Often this is done by simulating multiple outcomes from a stochastic process in a Monte Carlo simulation. Example applications include the simulation of gambling games (Poker and Blackjack for sure), fluid and particle dynamics (which is often used in computer graphics for animations), in genetics to determine the likelihood of phylogenetic trees (how species relate), and even the evolution of stock prices and interest rates over time."

    "Brownian motion is the random motion exhibited by particles which have been suspended in a gas or liquid. This random motion is caused by the collision of the particles with the atoms or molecules in the liquid or gas. Brownian Motion is named after the Botanist Robert Brown who observed the random movements in 1827. The relationship between Brownian Motion and financial markets dates back to a paper written many years later, in 1900, by Louis Bachelier entitled The Theory of Speculation. His paper was the first to propose the use of Brownian Motion to evaluate stock options. The paper did not surface until later works in deriving the famous Black Scholes options pricing formula developed by Fisher Black and Myron Scholes in 1973. In the context of stochastic processes used in finance, Brownian Motion is often described as a Wiener process, denoted by $W_t$. A Wiener process is described by the following properties,\n",

    "The original Geometric Brownian Motion stochastic process assumes that volatility over time is constant. In the early 1990's Steven Heston relaxed this assumption and extended the Geometric Brownian Motion model to include stochastic volatility. The resulting model is called the Heston model. In the Heston model volatility over time evolves over time according to the Cox Ingersoll Ross stochastic process. As such the model makes use to two Wiener processes, one for the Cox Ingersoll Ross process and another for the Geometric Brownian Motion process which uses the Cox Ingersoll Ross process as volatility. These two Wiener processes are correlated and can be constructed using a Cholesky Decomposition. The stochastic differential equation for the Heston model is given as,\n",

    "The Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) stochastic process is used to describe the evolution of interest rates over time. The CIR stochastic process was first introduced in 1985 by John Cox, Johnathan Ingersoll, and Stephen Ross. The CIR process is an extension of the Ornstein Uhlenbeck stochastic process. The stochastic process is often used in the valuation of interest rate derivatives and has been used in the Heston model to describe the evolution of volatility over time. One interesting characteristic of the CIR stochastic process is that it is mean-reverting. Mean reversion is the phenomena whereby a level tends to move towards the average level over time. In other words, if the average interest rate is 0.5%, and we simulate 500 independent CIR processes, we would expect the average interest rate at the end of the projection period to be approximately 0.5%.
