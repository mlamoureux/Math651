    "## Teamwork\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hell is other people.  (J.P. Sartre)\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, working with other people can be a pain, so why do we bother? \n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly, we bother because working with a team is often the only way we can accomplish a large task in a reasonable amount of time. With a team, you can assemble diverse skills, ideas and initiative into one large group that has all the necessary components to complete the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the working world, most people are explicitly involved in teamwork everyday. Imagine a task like building a bridge. One architect may design the bridge, but he relies on engineers to tell him what kinds of materials (steel beams, cables, concrete) will be strong enough to support his design. They rely on purchasing agents to go out and buy the appropriate materials, that meet the specificaltions of individual parts for the bridge. They count on skilled workers to assemble the parts. They have project managers to coordinate all aspects of the work, so it can be done quickly and reliably without interfering with travellers using the nearby roads. They even depend on financial people to pull together the money to fund the project, and lawyers and agents to make sure they meet all government regulations and rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a team, each person brings some important components to the table. These include\n",
    "- specific technical skills (and different people will have different skills)\n",
    "- trust (in their abilities, and in the ability and commitment of other members of the team)\n",
    "- communication \n",
    "- motivation and inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mathematicians, we are sometimes at a disadvantage in teamwork because we are so accustomed to working individually, often very focused and very intently, on clear, concise problems that are of deep interest to us. Or when we are in a team, it is a collaboration of two very similar people working on a specific mathematical problem. It is rare to see a mathematician collaborating with a purchasing agent, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the working world, you are often forced onto teams where you don't get to choose your team-mates, who might be very different than you (say, with very different skills) and whom you might not know well at all. This class is a good chance to practice team-work skills, as the people here are not too different than yourself, but different enough that you may face challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ideas on how to proceed in a team:\n",
    "\n",
    "_1. Start with communication, and trust building.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would suggest having regular team meetings, say twice a week, just to touch base on what each person is doing, and what are the short-term goals for each person that week. No \"work\" is done at these team meetings, just communicating where you are at.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, meet Monday morning for coffee (20 minutes) to say what you are working this week, what other things will distract you (other classes, exams, etc), schedule working meetings with other team members for later in the week if you need to work together. etc. Then meet on Friday (end of day) for a 20 minute coffee, to review what was accomplished that week, what do you have to look forward to next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staying in constant communication and observing that each of you is working, will help in the trust building.\n",
    "\n",
    "_2. Do a skills assessment for each member of the team\n",
    "\n",
    "At a dedicated meeting, discuss what your particular skills are (is it coding? Is it collecting data from interesting sources? Is it finding research papers? Is it connecting math research to real problems? Is it making nice looking presentations? Is it writing up math papers in TeX? Etc) Figure out what skills you can make best use of, for each member in the team. \n",
    "\n",
    "_3. Agree to ground rules for working. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many professional settings, there are clear ground rules on how people interact at work. As students, you may not have had to think about this too much, as school and social life seem to get merged. In professional settings, life is made easier by avoiding talking about certain topics, like\n",
    "- politics\n",
    "- religion\n",
    "- sex\n",
    "- social life\n",
    "- money, incomes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "All interesting topics, I'm sure, but save that for discussions with your friends. In the team, this is work-time, so stay focused on the work. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also fair to add to this list of forbidden topics, and remind your team members to stay on the professional topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might also want to discuss explicitly other rules like being on time, following through on work commitments, documenting your work, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "_4. Agree to outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you want out of the project? You should agree what you all hope to get out of this. As your prof, I want to see a significant piece of work that reflects the efforts of a team, not some loose assemblage of pieces from individuals. The final result, though, I am leaving to you to determine in detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have ideas on teamwork? Maybe you've seen a good webpage on this, or a nice book on how to work in teams. Feel free to post this for the group to share.\n"

    "A fusion reactor is a controlled nuclear fusion device, used to fuse light atoms into heavier atoms (e.g. hydrogen fused into helium), producing heat that can be used to power an electric generator. Fusion is of course the source of energy in our Sun. \n",

    "On earth, nuclear fusion has been achieved through the use of hydrogen bombs, which are actually initiated by atomic bombs (using nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium atoms). A bomb is an inconvenient source of energy, so people are interested in created controlled fusion to generate useful power.\n",

    "Current technology rely on tokomaks (toroidal-shaped magnetic bottles) or intense laser beams to force a plasma of hydrogen to fuse into helium. They have not yet reached the break-even point, where more energy is produced than what is consumed in initiating the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A company in B.C., named General Fusion, is attempted a method where physical pistons are used to compress a metal ball containing the plasma of hydrogen atoms. It is a novel idea, heavily funded, but also not yet able to achieve effective fusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of a mathematical modeling problem, we will look at a report by Michael Lindstrom, published in SIAM's Journal of Applied Math, which gives an interesting asymptotic analysis of the General Fusion approach. The reference is below. \n",

    "Consider the case of cooling a hot pipe by blowing a flow of air over it (perpendicular to the extension of the pipe). This would be a simple model of using a radiator to cool fluids in a car engine, or the cooling of hot pipes in a nuclear reactor. We assume a simple model where heat is carried away by the flow of the air (or other fluid), but the heat does not cause a change in the fluid flow. (i.e. we have no heat convection, just advection.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce the problem to 2D, so imagine a 2D flow of fluid, going from left to right, flowing over a disk of radius $a$ centered at the origin. (It would be nice to have a picture here. Damn you Jupyter!) Far from the disk, we impose a uniform flow $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) \\rightarrow (U,0)$ as $(x,y)\\rightarrow\\infty$, where the value of $U$ is one of our physical parameters in the problem. (It's a velocity.) Technically, this is a boundary condition (a boundary at infinity). \n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for  2D incompressible flow around the disk is straightforward (you can look it up in any fluid mechanics book, or even in a complex variables textbook). You define the harmonic function $$\\phi(x,y) = U (x + \\frac{a^2 x}{x^2 + y^2})$$ and set the velocity field to be\n",

    "\n",
    "Boundary conditions: well, at infinity we expect the temperature to reach some stable level $T_\\infty$. At the pipe boundary, we could impose various conditions -- eg we might like to model Newton's cooling law (rate of cooling is proportional to temperature difference) or involve the flow of heat within the pipe. But let's keep things simple and assume $T=T_a$ is constant at the pipe's surface.\n",

So you might want to think about you would impose such a condition on your selection of physical parameters. (Apparently they need some kind of independence.) \n",

    "$$M a = 0.$$\n",
    "Since the kernel of $M$ has dimension $k=n-r$, we can find exactly $k$ linearly independent vectors $a$ to solve this problem. Each one of these $a$ gives an independent, dimensionless variable $\\Pi_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we typically have integer entries for $M$, so vectors in the kernel can be scaled to rationals. (That is, we solve the matrix equation over the field of rationals.) Then bringing to a common denomiator, we can rescale the vectors $a$ to be integer-valued. \n",

But so is the sequence $\\{ \\exp(-n/\\epsilon) \\}, n=0,1,2,\\ldots $, if we keep the $\\epsilon$ positive. This gives a different kind of order of decay (more exponential). \n",

    "## Definition of asymptotic expansion\n",
    "\n",

    "So, looking at $\\int_0^\\epsilon \\frac{e^{-1/t}}{t} \\, dt,$ let's use integration by parts with $u = t$ and $dv = (1/t^2)e^{-1/t} dt.$ So $du = dt, v = e^{-1/t}$ and we get \n",

    "Music notes are typically generated by vibrations in some object (the strings of a violin, the wires in a piano, the metal bars in a xylophone, even vibrations of an air column in a clarinet, flute, saxophone, etc.) The pitch of a note is characterized by a frequency of vibration -- for instance, concert \"A\" is set at 440 Hertz (cycles per second). Pairs of notes sound nice together if their frequencies are in the ratio of a small integer fraction. For instance, A is 440 Hz, and E is 660Hz, which is 3/2 the frequency of A. (This interval, fro A to E, is called a perfect fifth. It is the first tone step you hear in the song \"Twinkle twinkle little star\", or in French \"Ah! vous dirai-je, maman.\") A leap by an octave is a doubling of frequency, such as 440Hz to 880 Hz (this the leap you hear in the tune \"SomeWhere over the rainbow\" from the Wizard of Oz.)\n",

Indeed, over the 8 octaves of a piano, the errors accumulate into something that is clearly noticable by ear.\n",
