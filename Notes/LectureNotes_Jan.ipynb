    "## Properties of the Fourier transform\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Fourier transform is almost its own inverse. In fact, we have that $$\\widehat{\\hat{f}}(t) = f(-t), \\mbox{for all $t$ in the space,}$$\n",
    "which says that applying the Fourier transform twice gives you back the original function, but with a minus sign in the argument. This also means you can recover the original function from its Fourier transform. For instance, on the real line, we have\n",
    "$$f(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat{f}(\\omega) e^{2\\pi i \\omega t} \\, dt. $$\n",
    "This is just like the original Fourier transform, except there is no minus sign in the exponential. (This is true in general on all those spaces above.)\n",
    "- The Fourier transform preserves the energy, or 2-norm of a function. We usually write this as $$\\| \\hat{f} \\|_2 = \\| f \\|_2,$$\n",
    "where the 2-norm is defined on a function $f$ as\n",
    "$$ \\| f \\|_2 = \\sqrt{ \\int_X |f(x)|^2 \\, dx }.$$\n",
    "Here, the integral is over whatever space the function is defined on, and $dx$ is the Haar measure for the group (usually Lebesque measure in our examples above). In the case of a discrete set, the integral is replaced with a sum.\n",
    "- if the function $f$ is real-valued, or even, or odd, then its transform will have some nice symmetry properties. You might like to figure these out. For instance, if $f$ is real-valued, then $\\hat{f}$ satisfies \n",
    "$$\\hat{f}(-\\omega) = \\overline{\\hat{f}(\\omega)}.$$\n",
    "That is, putting a negative in the argument is the same as taking a complex conjugate. In this case, we know that absolute value of the Fourier transform is an even function, so\n",
    "$$ | \\hat{f}(-\\omega) | = | \\hat{f}(\\omega) |,$$\n",
    "which tells us to expect mirror-image symmetry in the FT of a real function. (We saw this in MATLAB examples.)\n",
    "- The Fourier transform changes a product of functions into a convolution, and a convolution into a product. This is written succinctly as the two formulas\n",
    "$$ \\widehat{f\\cdot g} = f*g \\mbox{ and } \\widehat{f* g} = f\\cdot g. $$\n",
    "- Just a reminder that the convolution of two functions on the real line is given by the formula\n",
    "$$(f*g)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(t-s)g(s) \\, ds$$\n",
    "while the convolution of two functions on the integers is given by\n",
    "$$(f*g)(n) = \\sum_{m= -\\infty}^\\infty f(n-m)g(m).$$\n",
    "Convolution is the natural operation that arises when you multiply coefficients on polynomials in one variable (and also the natural operation when you turn a group into a group algebra.) \n",
    "- convolution with a sequence that has only a few non-zero elements is a natural way to introduce linear, time-invariant filter in signal processing and time series analysis. The properties of the filter can be deduced by looking at the Fourier transform of the sequence. This FT show how the filter behaves in the frequency domain. \n",

    "Math modeling is a bit of an art. We want to create a representation of some process that is quantitative, and allows us to do some calculations that produce insight into process. Ideally, the model should be validated by comparing its results with observations of the real process, and indeed we would like to use the model to make predictions about the process that we have not yet observed (but would like to). \n",

Identify variable, and their dependences, and formulate as systems of equations (with boundary conditions, as well as evolution equations). Often we rely on physical laws (e.g. conservation of mass, of energy), empirical laws (e.g. friction), or hypothesized laws (e.g. rates of predation depends on the product of the number of predators time the number of prey). Simpler models are often more useful than complex models for understanding key phenomena -- more complex models can be created as needed. (We should think about well-posedness of the problem as we develop the model.)\n",

(For instance, in modeling ocean waves, you might distinguish between long, slow waves that travel large distances, and the smaller wavelets generated by gusts of wind.) Each individual component may represent a problem to be solved on its own, and then all the pieces brought together for a final model. In many cases, exact analytic solutions can be obtained for the component pieces, \n",

It creeps along from a while, then the road clears and we rapidly go back to travelling at the speed limit. This is a weird phenomena -- there was nothing on the road to block the traffic, it just seemed to cluster up and slow down. \n",

    "For a simplified model, we do a continuous approximation. Imagine a straight length of road, with cars distributed on along the road. We define a function $\\rho = \\rho(x,t)$ to be the density of cars (say number of cars per meter of roadway -- this could be a fractional number), which varies with both position $x$ along the road, and time $t$. We assume all the cars at some point are moving with roughly the same velocity, which we denote by $v = v(x,t)$, a function that varies with both position and time. The flux $q=q(x,t)$ is the number of cars per second that pass through the point $x$ on the roadway, which can vary with the time $t$. Of course we have that flux is just the density times velocity, so\n",

So the rate of change of the number of cars is equal to the difference of those fluxes. In integral form, this says:\n",

While if $\\rho < 1/2, \\rho_x >0$, the density will be decreasing with time. This will tend to form a \"shock wave\" in the density of cars. That is, if there is a point on the road where the density passes from below 1/2 to above 1/2, the density before that point decreases, while the density after that point increases. This continues until you get the sharp shock wave. You car sees this as a transition into a very dense, slow moving region of cars, following by the clearing out of the road as you move into the rarified region after the shock. \n",
